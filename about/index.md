Hi there.

I am Cameron. I am a Plant Ecologist and Data Scientist with interests in ecophysiology, biogeography, and remote sensing. I am passionate about problems that exist at the intersection of environmental sciences, climate change, and machine learning. I am interested in the applications of remote sensing to automate and expedite data collection for problems related to global change. These interests have framed my understanding of ecological systems using a mix of bottom-up and top-down approaches. I believe these combined approaches are necessary for understanding the planet as an integrated earth system.

Outside of my academic interests, I enjoy road cycling and backpacking. I love the speed of moving fast and far on the bike, and the ability to travel and explore great distances through exercise. Alternatively, I love the slowness of a long backcountry trip, observing how small shifts in geology inform changes in plant species and plant commmunities.

Please keep up with my current and future project here, and feel free to contact me with any questions you have about me or my work. I'm always interested in new opportunities for discussion.

Thank you for visiting.
