Hi there.

I'm Cameron. I am a Plant Ecologist and Data Scientist with interests in plant ecophysiology, biogeography, global ecology, and remote sensing. I am passionate about computational approaches to problems that exist at the intersection of environmental sciences and climate change. This includes using machine learning and remote sensing to automate and improve data collection for problems related to global change. In understanding ecological systems, I consider a synthesis of bottom-up and top-down approaches. I believe these combined approaches are necessary for understanding the planet as an integrated earth system, from cell-level physiology to global climate conditions.

Outside of my academic interests, I enjoy road cycling, cooking, and backpacking. I love the speed of moving fast and far on the bike, to travel and explore great distances through exercise. Alternatively, I love the slowness of a long backcountry trip, observing how small shifts in geology reflect changes in plant species and plant communities. I thoroughly enjoy plant identification: I always make room for my Jepson Manual!

Please keep up with my current and future projects here, and feel free to contact me with any questions you have about me or my work. I'm always interested in new opportunities for discussion.

Thank you for visiting.
